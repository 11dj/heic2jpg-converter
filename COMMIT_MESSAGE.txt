Title:
------
Fix libheif dependency and cross-platform HEIC support

Body:
-----
This commit fixes the Windows HEIC conversion support:

1. Fixed libheif-rs version from 0.18 to 0.22
   - Version 0.18 had incorrect feature flags
   - Version 0.22 works correctly with default features

2. Updated Rust code for cross-platform compatibility:
   - macOS: Uses native 'sips' command (reliable, no external deps)
   - Windows/Linux: Uses libheif library for HEIC decoding
   - Added conditional compilation with #[cfg] attributes

3. Fixed import issues:
   - Cursor is only imported on non-macOS platforms
   - Command is only imported on macOS
   - libheif types only imported on non-macOS

4. Updated GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Simplified Windows build (may still need manual setup)
   - macOS and Linux builds work automatically
   - Removed auto-push to avoid conflicts

5. Added push-to-github.sh script:
   - For manual pushing with custom commit messages
   - Shows git status before committing

Platform Support Status:
- macOS: ✅ Full HEIC support (using sips)
- Linux: ✅ Full HEIC support (using libheif)
- Windows: ⚠️ Partial (code ready, needs libheif setup)

Files Changed:
- src-tauri/Cargo.toml (libheif version)
- src-tauri/src/lib.rs (conditional compilation)
- .github/workflows/build-all-platforms.yml (simplified)
- push-to-github.sh (new helper script)
